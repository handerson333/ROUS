**Problem:** 
The Internet of Things is growing larger everyday with millions of new devices coming online. These devices depend on reliable
networks to communicate and make decisions. Without these stable networks these devices have no other method of communication.

<br/>

**Solution:** 
To solve this problem, we have created a community of devices that can make social decisions in order to collaborate and
accomplish an objective. The devices are stateless and can communicate without the need of a reliable network communication.
Instead, these devices communicate directly with each other in order to make social decisions.
